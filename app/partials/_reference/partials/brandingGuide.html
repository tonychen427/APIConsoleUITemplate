<h2>Developer branding guide</h2>

<div>
We're excited that you're integrating Dropbox into your app! You'll need to follow these guidelines for us to approve your app for production status, and your app must continue to comply with these guidelines after it's been approved.
Naming your app
</div>
<br>
<div>
You'll need to give us a name for your Dropbox app:
Be creative :) The name shouldn't include the word "Dropbox".
It can't begin with "drop", be similar to Dropbox in sound or spelling, or otherwise refer to Dropbox (for example, "DB" or "DfB").
It should be the same as or include the name of your app.
If you're using the Dropbox Business API, we recommend adding "for Business" to distinguish your business app name from your single‐user app name.
Above all, your Dropbox app name and app name as used elsewhere shouldn't confuse or mislead users on your app's affiliation or association with Dropbox. For example, only use "for Dropbox" when it's necessary to distinguish your Dropbox app from your other apps; your brand should stand alone wherever possible.
Providing your logo
</div>
<br>

<div>
We'll also need your app's logo as part of the production application process:
It shouldn't include or look similar to the Dropbox logo or other Dropbox-related imagery.
It shouldn't include the word "Dropbox" or other words that suggest a connection to Dropbox.
It should be recognizably similar, if not identical, to your app logo as used elsewhere.
Your app's logo is shown to users on the app authorization page, as well as on their linked apps list.
Keep current
</div>
<br>

<div>
Please keep your app name, logo, website, contact info, and other important information up to date in the App Console and your account settings. This will provide a consistent and accurate experience for your users, and help us reach you if there's a problem with your app.
Referencing Dropbox in your app
</div>
<br>

<div>
You may only use the Dropbox name and logo in your app to identify or direct a user to a Dropbox integration or functionality. For example, you may use a Dropbox logo and "Save to Dropbox" text on a button to prompt a user to save a file to Dropbox.
You may only use the approved logos, available here. Remember that you may not copy or imitate the look and feel of Dropbox products.
Referencing Dropbox in your marketing
</div>
<br>

<div>
You may use the Dropbox name and logo in marketing for your app as long as you follow our Dropbox branding guidelines and this additional guidance:
Don't suggest that there's a partnership or that Dropbox endorses your app. For example, you can say "we're developers on the Dropbox API" or "API developers," but not "we partner with Dropbox" or "API partners."
You may only use the Dropbox logo to indicate compatibility with Dropbox.
Don't use the Dropbox brand repeatedly or as a prominent brand in your marketing—it's your app after all!
If you'll be doing significant marketing that includes the Dropbox logo, particularly in print or broadcast, please get approval by writing to brand@dropbox.com.
